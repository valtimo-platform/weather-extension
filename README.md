# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- A running Keycloak instance
- A running Postgresql server

## Configuration

- Add a properties file to the project root. This file should have the name ".env.properties"
    - The .env.properties.example file can be used as starting point

## Starting up

- Run the following command from a terminal in the project root: ```./gradlew bootrun```
- After the Valtimo backend application has finished starting up, the service is available at http://localhost:8080
    - The application uptime can be verified by calling [this API endpoint](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ping)

## Supporting containers

The Valtimo backend application requires a Keycloak instance and a database server. When running the application
locally, running Keycloak and the database locally as well is recommended. In
the [valtimo-docker-compose repository](https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-docker-compose), Docker compose
files are available to support the Valtimo application. This repository includes a guide on which Compose file to use.
